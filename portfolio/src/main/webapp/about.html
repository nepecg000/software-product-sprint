        <h1>Texas A&M University - College Station</h1>
        <h2>Major: Computer Science</h2>
        <h4>Born</h4>
        <b1>I was born in Kaohisung City, Taiwan.</b1>
        <h4><p2>Aspiration</p2></h4>
        <b1><p2>
            It was my first time touching programming language (C Language) in the first year of senior high <br>
            school. Even though it was confused for me to understand concepts between values and pointers.<br>
            I found I was interested in this field: which is close to machine and computer. It was from <br>
            there that through all my experiences, in both Michigan State University and Texas A&M University, <br>
            that I truly came to appreciate and respect my field.  
        </p2></b1>
        <h4><p3>Focus</p3></h4>
        <b1><p3>
            After completing two and half year of college at the Michigan State Universty, I transferred to Texas A&M University. <br>
            After taking course "Introduction to Computer Systems", I am much interested in low-level programming, such as <br>
            Operating System, Compiler Design, and Computer Organization and Architecture. In the future, I wish to learn about <br>
            some Cybersecurity, and combined with concept in Computer Architecture, to have much deeper knowledge on cybersecurity.
        </b1></p3>
        <h4><p4>Interests</p4></h4>
        <b1><p4>
            My favorite programming languages are C and C++.<br>
            I love travelling to new places and go skiing.<br>
        </p4></b1>
